# Contribution Guidelines

Anyone who is willing to participate in the project is permitted to contribute in any way, shape of form with whatever they can. However, they must first send an email to *matei@gardus.eu* in order to be marked as a direct collaborator to the project.
Most importantly, however, there are a few guidelines regarding contributing to this project:

## Guidelines

1. You must write your commits in the present tense, in a neutral mood, preferably in English. Romanian is permitted; however, consistency is recommended.
2. You must liberally include references to anything relevant to the commit, such as pull requests, issues and other commits.
3. You _**MUST**_ include documentation for every function, class and operation in the code. Lack of documentation results in a forced deletion of the commit.
4. You must have commits that are not based on any external library that might work in your environment. The source code must be portable, ergo any external library is forbidden. Inclusion of said external headers and libraries in the repository itself, however, is not forbidden. 
5. You must include all graphical assets used. While it is impossible for those files to be reviewed in the GitHub platform, the repository must contain all the assets necessary for the compiled program to run.

## Contact

Any commit to this project is allowed to be unannounced, provided it respects the 5 guidelines above. However, it is preferred if such changes are announced through any of the following methods:
* by e-mailing any of the other contributors
* by joining any of our discussion methods. We use *Gitter* and the *GitHub team discussion board*. Get an invite link from *matei@gardus.eu*
